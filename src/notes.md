* Number Types
 1. double - 64bit number, if I'm storing a number that has a decimal, just use double.
 2. float - less accurate than double, saves a teensy tiny bit on processing power
 3. int - integers

 * Java has four types of whole numbers:
    1. byte - up to 127
    2. short - up to 32767
    3. int - up to 2,147,483,648
    4. long - > ^

* jshell
    Command line REPL, with JRE installed, go to term or cmd, and jshell gets you in, /help, /exit

* Primitive Types - 
    There are 8, but as a newb we only really need to know 4.

    1. byte: -128 - 127
    2. short: -32768 - 32767
    3. int: -2,147,483,648 - 2,147,483,647
    4. long: naaaah real big
    5. float: +/- 3.4x10^38
    6. Double: +/- 1.8x10^308
    7. Char: thousands of chars, glyphs, symbols
    8. Boolean: true/false
